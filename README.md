### Project Description
Generates random food names to eat on random days

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
When we crave for food we try to eat it when we get the chance like if I would like to eat something today either I will eat it by today or max. tomorrow or sometimes we may get confused when to eat.So our project gives you a random date to eat it.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Randomly picking dates to eat food.
