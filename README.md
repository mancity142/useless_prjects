TEAM ROBOüéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TEAM ROBO


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abinu Alfred - RIT Kottayam
- Member 2: Devang Shaji - RIT Kottayam

### Project Description
A useless login system where you must grimace at your webcam if you enter the wrong password. If you succeed, The Rock approves. If not, you get trolled. It‚Äôs a completely over-engineered prank login.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People who forget passwords are not judged harshly enough by their devices. There is no personal shame, no webcam judgment, no mockery.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the Grimace-Based Login System‚Ñ¢. Enter wrong credentials, and your webcam will demand a ridiculous face. If not funny enough? Prepare to be clowned. If correct? The Rock raises an eyebrow and asks: "Are you sure?"
