### Project Description
Random Animal Fact Generator is a playful web app that delivers quirky, surprising, and completely unnecessary animal facts at the click of a button ‚Äî all wrapped in a soft, dreamy UI with floating bubble animations.
It's designed to be delightfully useless: no login, no data, no goal ‚Äî just pure, random entertainment.
Every click brings you a new animal fact with smooth animations and a touch of charm. Think of it as your digital escape from productivity.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We have too few ways to enjoy completely unnecessary facts.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Click a button. Get a fact. Be amazed. Repeat.
