### Project Description
GossipSpot is a fun, Kerala-themed AI web app that detects gossip-worthy zones in hall or event images. Users can upload top-view photos, and the app identifies cozy corners, dining areas, and scenic spots using AI-powered analysis. Designed with a dark, aunty-culture-inspired UI, it blends tech with local flair for a playful social tool

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In every event or college function, we all somehow magically know where the gossip happens ‚Äî behind the snack table, by the water cooler, near the corner chairs. But what if AI could actually prove it? What if we could map the unspoken social energy of a hall? That‚Äôs the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù GossipSpot solves ‚Äî by turning whispers into zones.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing GossipSpot ‚Äî the AI-powered snitch for your social scene. Just upload an image of your event hall, and we‚Äôll highlight exactly where the chitchat, snack raids, and selfie sessions are most likely to explode. It‚Äôs high-tech meets high-drama ‚Äî because why guess where the gossip brews when AI can tell you?
