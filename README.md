### Project Description
Chittappan_Advice is a hilariously useless yet fun web app where users upload a palm photo, enter their details, and receive wildly entertaining AI-powered future predictions. Think of it as the digital version of that one uncle who always gives unsolicited advice ‚Äî except powered by Google Gemini!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People aren‚Äôt getting enough free and completely unscientific predictions about their future. How will they know if they‚Äôll meet a cat tomorrow or become a dance analyst at the FIFA World Cup?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By combining palm photos, user details, and Gemini AI, we deliver quirky, point‚Äëwise future predictions that are as accurate as your horoscope app ‚Äî but 10x funnier.

## Technical Details
