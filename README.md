# Vazhi-illae-Kuzhi üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: 2 Muskeeters

### Project Description
Vazhi Illae Kuzhi is a fun and smart pothole detection app built with OpenCV and Streamlit. Just upload a photo of a road, and it‚Äôll scan the image, find the potholes (based on shape and size), and throw some hilarious roast messages at them. And for a little extra drama, it even creates a personalized ‚ÄúPothole Certificate‚Äù that you can download or share.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
India (and many other countries) face a serious road safety issue due to unidentified or poorly maintained potholes.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Vazhi Illae Kuzhi uses computer vision to detect potholes in road images automatically. It highlights them visually, roasts them humorously based on size, and creates a fun ‚ÄúPothole Certificate‚Äù that users can download or share ‚Äî making road issues easier to spot and harder to ignore.
