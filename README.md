# [Snack_Spy] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [The Sleuths]


### Team Members

### Project Description
[This fun computer vision project detects whether food has been fairly split between two people using image analysis. By comparing portion sizes, it helps resolve sibling conflicts over unequal food sharing with a ‚Äúfairness verdict".]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Siblings everywhere suffer from the age old injustice of one person getting the bigger slice of pizza or cake. These daily food disputes threaten peace at the dinner table. Our project aims to finally bring justice one plate at a time.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We use computer vision to analyze photos of shared food and calculate how fairly it‚Äôs been divided. Whether it‚Äôs pizza, cake, or fries , our model snitches on the sibling who took the bigger share and assigns a ‚ÄúFairness Score.‚Äù Because who needs therapy when you have algorithms?]

## Technical Details

# Run
[!python app.py]

### Project Documentation
For Software:This is a fun AI project that detects if food is fairly divided between two people, using image analysis.
Because life isn‚Äôt fair‚Ä¶ but snacks should be! Built to inject humor and tech into everyday conflicts, Snack Spy turns a common family drama into a gamified AI experience.
How it works:
1.Users upload two food plate images.
2.The backend uses AI (via rembg) to remove image backgrounds.
3.It calculates food area from the foreground in each image using OpenCV.
4.Then it compares the two and returns a similarity score and a cheeky verdict!
