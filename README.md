# Interview with Kuttan üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Byte Battlers


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sreedev Suresh - TKM College of Engineering Kollam

### Project Description
"Interview with Kuttan" is a sarcastic Malayalam interview bot that roasts you no matter what you say. You think you‚Äôre doing well? Anyways‚Ä¶ you are not getting hired.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are too happy after job interviews. There is not enough savage feedback in Malayalam to keep their ego in check.

We built Kuttan, the AI interviewer who asks you standard HR questions, listens to your answers, and responds with customised Malayalam roasts ‚Äî from Light Roast to Full Destruction.
