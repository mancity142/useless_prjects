Project Description
CATMOSPHERE is an interactive, pixel-art-inspired cat-themed website that lets users input "Meow" variations to generate a mood, watch a tiny animated cat roam through trees and clouds, and get redirected to a custom mood display page — all for absolutely no productive reason.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many people are using AI and web technologies for serious purposes like health, education, and finance. But what about the deep emotional need to communicate with cats using “Meow”?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
CATMOSPHERE solves this imaginary crisis by creating a cat-themed world where moods are detected based on how you meow. With pixel clouds, trees, and animations, it’s the purr-fect mix of nonsense and cuteness.
