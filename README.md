### Implementation
The idea of a chatbot in HTML is implemented by combining HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Letâ€™s break down the implementation into steps to understand how each part contributes to creating a basic chatbot:

1. HTML for Structure
Purpose: HTML provides the main structure of the chatbot interface.
Components:
A chat-container that acts as a wrapper for the entire chatbot.
A chat-box div where all messages (user and bot responses) are displayed.
An input area with a text field and a button for the user to type and send messages.
