### Project Description
Our project will help you to automatically turn on the switches whenever you plug in your charger. The main objective of our project is to ensure you never forget to turn on the switch when charging your phone.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Always forgot to turn on switch while charging mobile phone.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We added a infrared sensor in the switch board which senses the objects infront of it , so that whenever we plug in our charger it will detect and turn on the switch.
