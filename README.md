# Too Many Buttons üéØ


## Basic Details
### Individual : Zamaan Nalakath

### Project Description
Too Many Buttons is a completely unnecessary game designed to waste your time in the most entertaining way possible. You‚Äôre presented with 100 blank buttons. One of them says ‚ÄúWin.‚Äù But you don‚Äôt know which one. Every click reshuffles the entire board. You might win. But probably not.

Like Minesweeper, but with no logic.
Like life, but with more buttons.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There are too many buttons in life.
So we made a game with even more ‚Äî
100+ identical ones,
and only one works.

Nobody needed this.
But we built it anyway.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
When faced with too many meaningless options,
we added more.
And called it a game.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML,CSS,Java Script

### Implementation

For Software:

Frontend Only:
This project is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript ‚Äî no frameworks, no libraries, no backend.

Core Logic:
Create 100+ identical buttons dynamically
Randomly assign one hidden ‚ÄúWin‚Äù button

On every click:
Display a message (win or lose)
Shuffle all buttons with a fade-out/fade-in animation
Track total time since the game started

Design Choices:
Buttons have no labels (pure guessing)
Shuffle is visible for psychological damage
UI is minimalist and slightly hostile

Files:
index.html ‚Äì Structure
style.css ‚Äì Visual pain
script.js ‚Äì Game logic and timer
